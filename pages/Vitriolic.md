preface: |
    Vitriolic was developed in my final year group project module, where myself and 10 other students from both the Computer Games Programming and Computer Games Modelling and Animation courses, designed and developed the game completely from scratch.

The game itself was developed for PC in Unreal Engine 4, with a mixture of C++ and UE4 Blueprints. We managed to win the 'Playground Games Best Game Award' and the 'Best Art Direction' awards at the Games@Derby Expo 2018.

My role in the project consisted of programming various user interface and intermediate components, along with a few gameplay elements. As me and most of the other programmers were new to Unreal Engine 4, we all decided to develop most of the game with Unreal's Blueprint system. However, some of the features I developed were made with C++.

##### My Contributions

###### **Entirety of player's HUD**
* Health and Ability bars with required effects.
* Dynamic combo counter that appears when necessary.
* Tooltips for weapon swapping and entering certain areas.
* Screen FX for low health and death screens.
* Screen transitions.

###### **Interactable Keypad Puzzle and its accompanying UI**
* Randomly generated 4 digit code that is displayed in game as an environment puzzle.
* Fully integrated with controller input, as developed by another team member.

###### **Asynchronous loading between scenes**
* Main Menu and Loading screen scenes, with animated loading sprites.
