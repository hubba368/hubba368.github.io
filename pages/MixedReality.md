Developed during the Mixed Reality module of my master's degree, we were tasked with designing and developing a mixed reality (AR,VR etc) experience that fit your design. Having spent many hours playing various swordfighting VR games such as Blade & Sorcery, I wanted to create a VR game that focussed on creating authentic sword handling, while choosing the Royal Armouries Museum as an appropriate setting for the game.

##### Features
* Continuous locomotion & snap turning alongside animated hand models.

* Interactable sword items that have customised physics interactions with other objects, and unique physics and sound FX when handled by the player through Unity Configurable Joint components.

* Other interaction items, such as an elevator that requires manual use, and a small simon says type game that requires physical contact with the swords to play.
