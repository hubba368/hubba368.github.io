Developed as part of my Master's degree module, 'Human-AI Interaction' we were tasked with developing an experience that made use of Natural Language Processing in whatever way you saw fit. So, I decided to develop a small text-based game where you play the role of a travelling merchant who has to convince customers to buy their products and make a profit.
